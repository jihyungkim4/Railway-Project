# Railway Project (might need fixing)

A full-stack Java web application simulating a train reservation system, developed as a university course project.
Users can browse train schedules, make reservations, interact with customer representatives, and manage their bookings.
Admins can modify schedules, stations, and customer data.

Uses Java, HTML, MySQL

Note: My contribution was in a different branch from the original repository I copied, but we couldn't merge so each new edition of the project was a new branch that just updated the files of the last one, meaning this is the latest one with all updates including mine.
